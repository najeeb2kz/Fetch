## Credits:
I have to give credits to General Motors where I learned to make enterprise level 
vehicle and mobile apps. I have used the same architecture and libraries in this project.

## Description: 
-I've create this project/app for Fetch hiring team.  
-Even though the requirements were simple I wanted to show my skills and knowledge in Android development.  
-In this project, I've used industry standard libraries and architecture which include:
    - MVVM architecture
    - ViewModel
    - Retrofit
    - RecyclerView
    - ConstraintLayout
    - Material Design
    - LiveData
    - DataBinding
    - DaggerHilt for dependency injection
    - Room Database
    - SQLite
    - Coroutines (Better than RxJava)
    - Created launcher icons, took screenshots from Fetch website
    - Matched the colors with Fetch website
    - Created libs.version.toml file for managing dependencies
    - Used Kotlin language
    - Latest Gradle and Gradle plugin
    - It took me two complete days, 16 hours each day to complete this project but very happy with the outcome :)
